# Backlog

What is queued, in priority order, so that work follows the list rather than
whatever was last noticed. One line of context each; the reasoning lives in the
discussion the line points to. A finished item is removed, not ticked — its
record is the discussion and the commit.

Priorities: **P0** now, **P1** next, **P2** when nearby, **P3** recorded so it
is not rediscovered, **parked** decided-not-now with the reason on file.

## P0

Nothing now.

## P1

Nothing now.

## P2

Nothing now.

## Parked, with the reason on file

- **A query over what is drawn, for an agent to read.** An agent debugging the
  view guesses a pixel's cause from its color in a screenshot. The profiler's
  half is answered: the console's `pxl.profiler.report()` gives its window as
  text (`ts/client/src/shell/debug/console.ts`). What a screen point draws is
  not: the block its ray met, with its face, zoom and distance, and where that
  block was read from, asked of the running page and answered as text. The
  answer is the GPU's, the ray's words read back (`pxl-spec-core ray.rs`), since
  the CPU's `first_hit` (`pxl-kernel domain/query/ray.rs`) can disagree where
  the samples miss a thin face
  ([20261024-a-proxy-only-starts-the-ray.md](./minutes/20261024-a-proxy-only-starts-the-ray.md)).
  Answering it might be where a language for agents to query the view starts.
  Not urgent: no debugging under way needs it.
- **WASI, as a subsystem over the contract.** An adapter that offers a WASI
  program WASI's calls translated into the contract's requests, which is what
  would let an existing program in. Not without one to build it against; guests
  stay `wasm32-unknown-unknown` meanwhile —
  [20260930-wasi-and-the-boundary.md](./minutes/20260930-wasi-and-the-boundary.md).
