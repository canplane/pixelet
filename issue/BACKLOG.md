# Backlog

What is queued, in priority order, so that work follows the list rather than
whatever was last noticed. One line of context each; the reasoning lives in
the discussion the line points to. A finished item is removed, not ticked —
its record is the discussion and the commit.

Priorities: **P0** now, **P1** next, **P2** when nearby, **P3** recorded so
it is not rediscovered, **parked** decided-not-now with the reason on file.

## P0

- **How the samples are drawn.** On the iPhone 13 mini, four shapes over the
  same pages and views: today's boxes, the same as masked faces, a ray a
  pixel, and a bounded observation a cell — what the rule asks for, a cell
  being an angular footprint and not a sample point. The steps a cast pays
  are measured already, and where on the screen they lie
  ([20260928-what-is-drawn-is-what-the-screen-covers.md](./20260928-what-is-drawn-is-what-the-screen-covers.md),
  "the steps, measured").

## P1

- **The device's image binding, built once.** `a59f64e4` changed
  `pxl_image_hold` to take the kernel's handle, and with it the Swift and
  Kotlin bindings (`PlatformModule`, `PxlCore`); the Rust side is checked for
  both targets, the bindings only by a device build, at the next one.

- **Decor and the badges on the drawn chunks, seen running.** `4da038fc`
  and `98e4f790` moved them onto the chunks the terrain draws; checked by
  the tests and the build only. Zoom and pan on the dev stack: decor and
  badges change with the ground under them, and no tree is lost or doubled
  at a chunk's top or edge. `e7893bdb` moved the badges' globe and viewport
  onto the frame's uniform: they stand, size and bend over the planet as
  before. The gizmos' labels no longer blink while the camera moves. `01215a04`
  and the commit after it moved the up, the viewport and the fog onto the
  frame's uniform: the stars, the screen-space AO, the sky and the clouds
  look as before.

## P3

- **What the sky left open.** Recorded 2026-09-22
  ([the sky is the air](./20260922-the-sky-is-the-air.md)), each small and
  none blocking:
  - The terrain stands at its elevation and the planet's ground past it at sea
    level, so from high up a far piece of terrain floats over it with its
    chunk walls showing. Setting the ground at the map center's height, or
    skirting the coarse levels down to it, would close it.
  - Clouds with a thickness: a slab a kilometer or two deep, sampled a few
    times a pixel, for the volume a side view misses — as a quality setting,
    since it is several times today's cost. Volumetric clouds proper are out
    while the client draws at rest every two seconds.
  - The Milky Way, which a naked-eye catalog does not make (a low-resolution
    all-sky texture, whose licenses are attribution ones), and the bright
    planets, which the sun's and the moon's low-precision formulas extend to.
  - The themes' remaining fill — ambient, hemisphere, the floor — from the
    sky's irradiance, the way the sunlight now comes from the air. The floor
    is there for a phone's night and would resist it.

## Parked, with the reason on file

- **Coarse tiers: draw calls, a wider unit.** Not a bottleneck after the
  direct path; not without a measurement —
  [20260912-coarse-tiers-what-the-field-does.md](./20260912-coarse-tiers-what-the-field-does.md).
- **Characters and the rest without a record format.** Not before the format.
- **WASI, as a subsystem over the contract.** An adapter that offers a WASI
  program WASI's calls translated into the contract's requests, which is what
  would let an existing program in. Not without one to build it against;
  guests stay `wasm32-unknown-unknown` meanwhile —
  [20260930-wasi-and-the-boundary.md](./20260930-wasi-and-the-boundary.md).
