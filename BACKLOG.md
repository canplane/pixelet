# Backlog

What is queued, in priority order, so that work follows the list rather than
whatever was last noticed. One line of context each; the reasoning lives in
the discussion the line points to. A finished item is removed, not ticked —
its record is the discussion and the commit.

Priorities: **P0** now, **P1** next, **P2** when nearby, **P3** recorded so
it is not rediscovered, **parked** decided-not-now with the reason on file.

## P0

Nothing now.

## P1

- **Close the view's bound by area, and let the eye's rays measure it.**
  The cell is a solid angle (4b1fd556f) and a screen holds at most
  `GRID_CELLS_MAX`, but drawn cells are not yet held to a quarter of one:
  the error box is a cube judged from a chunk's nearest point, so ground
  seen at a grazing angle is drawn four and more times finer than its cell
  (the camera gizmo's blue, the far half of a 60° view). Decide in one
  design: the bound in the form it must hold (visible cells ≤ 4 × the
  grid's), what measures a cell's shown area — the rays of the camera grid,
  a cell's footprint on what it meets, cast on the CPU or read back from a
  GPU feedback pass as virtual texturing does (the decision of 20260928
  already names "the GPU's feedback" as a better estimator) — and how the
  choice stays on the main axis, the grid deciding the chunk, the chunk
  asking the query, nothing beside the hierarchy. Near "How the samples are
  drawn" above.

## P2

## Parked, with the reason on file

- **Publishing**: a push to `deploy`, any upload to the bucket (terrain, places,
  divisions) and the copy into production's db-geo, held until the user says
  the time is right, since the bake side has refactoring ahead. Meanwhile a
  bake is looked at through `dev:shelf` and `preview:shelf`.
- **How the samples are drawn**, held until the user says the time is
  right. On the iPhone 13 mini, four shapes over the same tiles and views: today's boxes, the same as masked faces, a ray a
  pixel, and a bounded observation a cell — what the rule asks for, a cell
  being an angular footprint and not a sample point. Each shape is built
  whole on the CPU and whole on the GPU, one representation either way:
  CPU or GPU is a question of the whole drawing, never of one kind of
  thing sent to the other side. The steps a cast pays
  are measured already, and where on the screen they lie
  ([20260928-what-is-drawn-is-what-the-screen-covers.md](./decision/20260928-what-is-drawn-is-what-the-screen-covers.md),
  "the steps, measured").
- **WASI, as a subsystem over the contract.** An adapter that offers a WASI
  program WASI's calls translated into the contract's requests, which is what
  would let an existing program in. Not without one to build it against;
  guests stay `wasm32-unknown-unknown` meanwhile —
  [20260930-wasi-and-the-boundary.md](./decision/20260930-wasi-and-the-boundary.md).
